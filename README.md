# Timer Program

The Timer Program is a Java application that allows the user to start and stop a timer in "HH:MM:SS" format, and set a countdown timer in the same format. The program is implemented using Swing components and runs on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT) for thread safety. This timer does not work at this time
